# M U S I V E R S E

Musiverse is a curses-based modern, minimal, fully customizable and hackable terminal music player. It's currently in the pre-alpha stage, so expect bugs and some spaghetti code. I *will* eventually refactor it and the code will look gorgeous, so no need to worry about that. The player can play anything that can be streamed from YouTube, although it can't even play any audio yet. I'll add more features and plugin support in the future.

## Short-term TODO

- [ ] Space to select songs globally for addition to a playlist (globally = in any screen showing songs) [WIP]
- [ ] Add a playlist to another playlist
- [ ] Create the player thing

- [ ] Create a "queue" buffer for songs to be played. Instead of directly playing a playlist, you can "enqueue" it. The queue can be edited like a playlist. Create another mode in the library screen for this.
